# Vulnerability-Management-with-Nessus
**Objective**

- The objective of this project was to gain practical experience in vulnerability management using Nessus Essentials. By installing and configuring Nessus to conduct vulnerability scans on a Windows 10 host, both non-credentialed and credentialed scans were performed. Additionally, an outdated Firefox installation was scanned to assess its vulnerabilities. The aim was to identify vulnerabilities within the target systems and understand the remediation process. The project also involved setting up recurring scans to maintain continuous monitoring of the host's security posture.


**Skills Learned**

- Installation and configuration of Nessus Essentials.
- Execution of vulnerability scans on target systems.
- Assessment of vulnerabilities in third-party software (e.g., Firefox).
- Analysis and interpretation of Nessus scan results.
- Implementation of remediation measures.


**Tools Used**

- Nessus Essentials for vulnerability scanning.
- VMware for hosting the Windows 10 virtual machine.


**Steps**

1. Installation and configuration of Nessus Essentials.
2. Preparation of the Windows 10 host and installation of an outdated Firefox version.
3. Execution of non-credentialed vulnerability scans on the Windows 10 host.
4. Execution of credentialed vulnerability scans on the Windows 10 host.
5. Vulnerability assessment of the outdated Firefox installation.
6. Analysis of Nessus scan results and identification of vulnerabilities.
7. Implementation of remediation measures to address identified vulnerabilities.
8. Documentation of the project process on GitHub for sharing and reference.
